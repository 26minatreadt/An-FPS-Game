# An FPS Game
Ive been curious about messing with FPS for awhile and i want to try different mechanics on this project
the goal is a singleplayer/multiplayer game that is wave based against pve or a pvp gamemode with fast paced movemnent
and items to assist your movement aswell

Not confirming anything but im gonna try to work towards that this is my first time working on something of this size so please be patient with me! thank you all and have fun with it
